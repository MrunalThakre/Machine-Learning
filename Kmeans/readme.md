# Driver Classification for Incentives and Warnings

This repository contains a project to develop a machine learning model using the K-means algorithm to help a transport company identify driver groups for incentives and warnings.

## Project Overview

### 1. Data Analysis
Analyze and preprocess the dataset to prepare it for clustering.

### 2. K-means Clustering
Apply the K-means algorithm to cluster drivers based on their performance metrics.

### 3. Group Identification
Identify driver groups that should receive incentives and warnings based on clustering results.
