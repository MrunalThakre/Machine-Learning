# Bank Default Prediction

This repository contains a project to develop a machine learning model to determine if a person will default on a bank loan using ensemble learning techniques and artificial neural networks.

## Project Overview

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyze and visualize the dataset to understand the distribution and relationships of the features.

### 2. Random Forest Algorithm
Apply the Random Forest algorithm to classify individuals as potential defaulters or non-defaulters.

### 3. Adaboost Algorithm
Use the Adaboost algorithm to improve classification performance through boosting.

### 4. Model Evaluation
Evaluate the performance of the classification models using the following metrics:
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Accuracy

### 5. Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
Develop an ANN to predict whether a person will default on a bank loan.

### 6. K-Fold Cross Validation
Apply k-fold cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance and ensure robustness.

### 7. Hyperparameter Tuning
Optimize model parameters to enhance prediction accuracy and performance.
