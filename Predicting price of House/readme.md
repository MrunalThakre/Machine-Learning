# House Price Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning model to predict house prices on boston.csv. The project involves:

- Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Applying Linear Regression
- Applying Multiple Linear Regression
- Evaluating the model's performance using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² Score
- Applying hyperparameter tuning to improve performance

## Project Overview

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyze and visualize the dataset to understand the underlying patterns and relationships.

### 2. Linear Regression
Apply simple linear regression to model the relationship between the target variable and one predictor.

### 3. Multiple Linear Regression
Extend the model to include multiple predictors for better accuracy.

### 4. Model Evaluation
Evaluate the performance of the regression models using the following metrics:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R² Score

### 5. Hyperparameter Tuning
Optimize model parameters to improve prediction accuracy and performance.
