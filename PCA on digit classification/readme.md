# Digit Classification with PCA and Logistic Regression

This repository contains a project that applies a dimensionality reduction technique, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), on a digit classification dataset and then uses logistic regression to generate the model.

## Project Overview

### 1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Reduce the dimensionality of the digit classification dataset to simplify the data and enhance the efficiency of the model.

### 2. Logistic Regression
Implement logistic regression on the PCA-transformed data to classify digits.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
