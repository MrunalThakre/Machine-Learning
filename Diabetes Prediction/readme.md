# Diabetes Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning model to predict whether a person has diabetes using the `diabetes.csv` dataset. The project involves:

- Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Applying Logistic Regression
- Applying Decision Tree Algorithm
- Applying K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Evaluating the model's performance using Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and Accuracy
- Applying Hyperparameter Tuning to improve performance

## Project Overview

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyze and visualize the dataset to understand the distribution and relationships of the features.

### 2. Logistic Regression
Implement logistic regression to classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic.

### 3. Decision Tree Algorithm
Use a decision tree classifier to make predictions based on the feature set.

### 4. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Apply the KNN algorithm to classify individuals based on the proximity of their feature values to others in the dataset.

### 5. Model Evaluation
Evaluate the performance of the classification models using the following metrics:
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Accuracy

### 6. Hyperparameter Tuning
Optimize model parameters to enhance the prediction accuracy and performance of the classifiers.
