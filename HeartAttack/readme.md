# Heart Attack Prediction

This repository contains a project to develop a machine learning model to predict whether a person will suffer from a heart attack.

## Project Overview

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyze and visualize the dataset to understand the distribution and relationships of the features.

### 2. Naive Bayes Classifier
Apply the Naive Bayes classifier to predict the likelihood of a heart attack.

### 3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Use the Support Vector Machine algorithm to classify individuals based on their risk of heart attack.

### 4. Model Evaluation
Evaluate the performance of the classification models using the following metrics:
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Accuracy

### 5. Hyperparameter Tuning
Optimize model parameters to improve prediction accuracy and performance.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
